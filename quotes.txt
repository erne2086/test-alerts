“The first ten million years were the worst," said Marvin, "and the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third ten million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of a decline.”
“Marvin was humming ironically because he hated humans so much.” 
“Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it.” 
“It's part of the shape of the Universe. I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate me.”
